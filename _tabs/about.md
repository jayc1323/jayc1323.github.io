# Current 
I recently finished the MSCS program at Tufts University.
I worked as a Research Assistant in the Programming Languages group at Tufts University, under the guidance of postdoctoral scholar Vadim Zaliva and Prof. Jeff Foster from July - Dec 2025, where I contributed towards the development of a new programming language which tracks poison propogation through its type system . I  built key components of the interpreter including the parser , typechecking and evaluation for different kinds of expression forms like functions , binary operators ,let expressions. Also implemented new expressions like externs ,strings , and also unit testing framework as well as setting up continous integration through Github actions.

I am pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at Tufts University. Before enrolling in the Master’s program, I successfully completed the Postbac program in Computer Science at Tufts, which provided me with a solid foundation in computer science and prepared me for more advanced courses.

My areas of interest include software engineering and programming languages . Other topics I like learning about are systems and networking, web development and theoretical computer science.
I have programming experience in the following languages:
- Object-Oriented Languages: C, C#, C++, Java,JavaScript, Python
- Functional Languages: Lean, Standard ML,Haskell,Scheme
- Frameworks : NodeJS , ASP.NET

Additionally, I consistently work on LeetCode problems.[Profile](https://leetcode.com/u/jayc13231999/)
