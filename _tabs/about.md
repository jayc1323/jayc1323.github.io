# Current 
- Currently working as a Research Assistant in Programming Languages at Tufts University in the Tufts University programming languages group. (July 2025 - Present) , working under the guidance of postdoc scholar [Vadim Zaliva](https://zaliva.org/) and [Prof. Jeff Foster](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jfoster/)
<br>.
- The project I have been contributing to - [poison_lang](https://github.com/jayc1323/poison-lang/)

I am currently pursuing the [_Master in Computer Science_](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/current-students/graduate/ms-computer-science) degree at [__Tufts University__](https://www.tufts.edu/). Prior to enrolling in the Master's ,I successfully completed the 
Postbac in CS at Tufts,which builds a foundation in CS and prepares you for higher level courses. <br>
My areas of interests are __software engineering , programming languages__  and I also get interested
and like to explore other topics like  _systems/networking,web development,machine learning,theoretical CS_ from time to time.
I have experience programming in :<br>
__Object Oriented/procedural langauges__ - C ,Javascript, C++,Java ,Smalltalk,Python
<br>
__Functional Languages__ - Lean , StandardML , Scheme
<br> 
and am trying to learn Haskell,Elm and web technologies like NextJS,NodeJS.
<br>
Also attempt leetcode problems consistently .[Profile](https://leetcode.com/u/jayc13231999/)
